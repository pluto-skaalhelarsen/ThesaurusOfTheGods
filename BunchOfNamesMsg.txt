Hello there again. It's me. I just want to let you know up front that I'm also forwarding this to the following mailing list:

Mike and Jane Johnson; Fred Hampton; Joyce Herrera and her friend Robert Thompson; Albert Nottingham; Peter Albus; Herbert and Marth Alexander; Biff Anderson; the Smith twins; Alicia and Ken Robertson;
Maureen Kelly; Samuel and Debbie Abbott; Van Keller; Zane and Andrea Krauss; Silvia and Fred Gardner; Greg Koch; Bill and Maria Harrison; all those McDonald people; Valerie Chambers; Patsy and Ned Kline;
Andy and Olivia Welch; Felix and Felice Cantrell; Sandra and Olive Haines; Bill and Ted Barr; Donald and Ginny Robbins; Samantha and Thomas Lowery; Anthony Silva; Roy Rodriguez; Paul and Angela Rivera;
Nathan and Juanita Samson; Walter and Trudy Zimmerman; the Walker boys; Fran and Lisle Cisco; Hayden and Rudy Griggs; Frank Williams; Sonny Dupree; Betty and Annie Singer; Patricia and William Kenedy;
Dan and Rosie Thornton; Horace Heath; John and Joan Wilson; Tim and Tami Hartman; Vanessa and Gilbert Zamora; Steve and Geraldine Little; Hannah and Evan Mathews; Kent Clarkson

So, I think we can say we've got several areas covered. I'd like to think we've at least partly covered Bellefontaine, Cincinnati, Dallas, Albuquerque, Boston, Fayette, Bakersfield, Denver, Phoenix,
Toledo, Fargo, Pittsburg, Nashville, Asheville, Portland, Buffalo, Tacoma, Dover, Aspen, Miami, and Sarasota. I'd like to think there are more that are partly covered and will improve later,
like Madison, Biloxi, Seattle, Dayton, Tupelo, Plains, Amarillo, Scottsdale, Durango, Carbondale, and so forth.

Let me know later what you think.
