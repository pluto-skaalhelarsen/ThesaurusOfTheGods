On the basis of this assumption, approximate analytic expressions for the range and endurance of jet airplanes may be derived which reveal the important factors in determining the range and endurance of these aircraft.

Because of the viscosity effects, a rotating cylinder induces circulation in the air surrounding it which is irrotational in character. Assume that the flow about such a cylinder is of the two dimensional type and that the velocity five feet from the center is fifty feet per second. What is the strength of the vortex, and what is the tangential velocity at a point one foot from the center of rotation?

The troposphere is the region in which most clouds are formed and is characterized by tranquil, non turbulent conditions.

The doctrine of resurrection has also received support among them, for they acknowledge both that the flesh will rise again and that it will be immortal, in the same manner that the soul is already imperishable.
