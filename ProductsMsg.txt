I never get this much time off from the office routine. I hardly know what to without the company breathing down my neck. Is there life without business?

So, help me pick something out at the shoestore tomorrow. I need a pair of boots and some flip-flops. Maybe some new slipper things, or a slip-on type, anyway. The sneakers I have are all worn out, too.

Come by the store early and we'll have some coffee first - maybe cookies, too. I know your taste in goodies. We can drop by the company on the way and pick up my check.

I forgot. One sandal has a broken strap. I'll have to replace those as well. This could end up taking a while, so maybe take a candy break at the apartment. Have some snacks, if not lunch. I've always got a few chips and crackers. Later we can stop at the drivein down the street, of pop in at that deli.

Get back to me right away. I know you've always wanted to be a hot-shot corporation type. I'll put in a good word at the company.
